You keep the diamond in your pocket and open the creaky door. But, when you step inside a glowing pit of lava surrounds you. Luckily,there are stepping stones in a variety of sizes and shapes, some really small, or some really big, some really round, or some really wonky. You have no choice but to keep on going to you build up enough courage to jump onto a stone which is big enough for you to stand on two feet. The second step isnt as stable as the but you manage to stand on it safely on one foot,as it isnt big, your happy your not dead by now . One after another, you step on the stones. You are almost there, you can see the end. You jump onto the last stone and you are safe.
