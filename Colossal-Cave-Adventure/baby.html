You enter a spooky large room with blood on the pink and white striped walls. Slowly,you creep towards the sound of a snoring, sleeping baby. The baby wakes up and opens their eyes,they snap at you with their sharpened, blood red teeth. The baby managed to wedge their teeth into your arm. Your arm is bleeding and the baby drops to the floor coughing out a shiny,blue crystal. Luckily, your clothes work as a good bandage. After you wrap your jacket around your arm you make your way to the next door, picking up the crystal on the way.
