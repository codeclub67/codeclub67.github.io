You have found the power gems and you have been teleported to Steves jail. You look around, trying to find Steve and after ten minutes of walking around you have a stroke of luck and find him.
 "HELPPP!" Steve needs something to get him out, but you dont know what! "IT HAS TO BE DONE. I DONT WANT TO, BUT I HAVE TO!" Abright light shines in the room and you look away, but you have to give in...
