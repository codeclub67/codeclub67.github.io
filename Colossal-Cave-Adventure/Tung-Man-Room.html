It seems too late to die and you end up faceplanting the ground and become unconscious. You seem to be getting pulled away by it. You wake up in this weird empty bedroom. All there is is a bend with the tung sahur led on it. You hear a voice behind you saying "You are not supposed to be here". You turn around and see a man with a gun. He says "You are not supposed to be here". You say "I am not supposed to be here". You slowly crouch around the room, it feels like escaping the Warden in Minecraft, soon realizing that there is no door or window. 
All you can see that may help is a glowing pink power gem on the unoticed shelf. You end up running to the shelf and look at it.
