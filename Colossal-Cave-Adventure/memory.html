You are in a room with a lot of computers and without a lot of bats playing fortnite.
It seems to be the lab, a mysterious room in the south of the building. But something is different. Steve is there and he seems to be unconsious. He gets pulled away by a spirit, the exact one earlier.
You realize that this is a memory, the memory when steve was pulled away. Now you can change it all. You run towards the lava chicken and you pick it up.
Now you can go back and free Steve.
