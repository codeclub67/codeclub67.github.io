Dark and creepy vents with a big fat hairy spider on the ceiling.
A chill runs down your spine as you get the feeling that you are not alone and whoever is listening to you can hear your
every breath.
A cheese grater falls from the ceiling.
A mans body falls onto the ground that is covered in blood then the door slams shut the lights go out and a lot of miny
death spiders come out of the vents and you scream.
Then you hear a screen turn on and you look at it .You gulp as you see a woman with no emotions on her face.Her wrinkly
hand reaches out and attempts to grab you.she is holding a cheese grater.You scream .
You are scared of cheese graters.
Then all of a sudden the screen turns off and you hear a loud noise and you almost die.
You run backwards and trip over a bump and fall through a secret door you weren,t meant to find. You find yourself on a
bridge. As you stand up you realize there is lava underneath you. The next thing you know you are falling into the lava.
You scream as you fall.
All of a sudden you start to float and you are able to find your way to the straightest path you have and ever will see.
Then you exit the lava area and you go of to find your teamates and you go to find the BIGGEST CHEESE GRATER OF ALL TIME
and you battle it and you win.
