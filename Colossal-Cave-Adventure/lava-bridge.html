You run backwards and trip over a bump and fall through a secret door you weren,t meant to find. You find yourself on a bridge. As you stand up you realize there is lava underneath you. The next thing you know you are falling into the lava. You scream as you fall.
 You end up in a lava pit. A gem is upon your eyes, you pick it up and you seem to not die. It is a miracle to all of mankind and you are able to find your way to the straightest path.
