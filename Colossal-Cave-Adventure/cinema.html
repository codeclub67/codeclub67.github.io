You enter the door to the West.It leads you to an empty cinema that looks like it has been abandoned for a long time.A chill runs down your spine as you get the feeling that you are not alone and whoever is listening to you can hear your every breath.Suddenly,you hear a screen turn on and you look at it .You gulp as you see a woman with no emotions on her face.Her wrinkly hand reaches out and attempts to grab you.You scream and run back to the entrance.
