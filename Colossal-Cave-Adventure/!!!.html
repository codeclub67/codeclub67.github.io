You enter this unknown room and you see a face.The face reminds you of the monster you used to see in your nightmares.It's asleep and won't wake up.You feel its skin and it feels like rubber.The eyes slowly open and you flinch.It attempts to lick you and you feel a slimy tongue touch your neck.You scream and run to the passage.
