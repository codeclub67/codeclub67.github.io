Make up a simple 3 or 4 line story, or use a nursery rhyme like “Humpty Dumpty.”
* The stage drives the story, broadcasting a message for each line
* Position and move your characters
* Add speech bubbles
* Show and hide characters when they appear or disappear in your story
* Animate sprites by changing costumes quickly.
